Breaking News: AI expert board of the United Nations planned to be replaced by machine learning algorithms by 2025. 

Under the decreasing financial commitments of several large members, in the context of the current Covid-19 pandemic, many specialized agencies of the United Nations got under increasing pressure to decrease their spending. 

In the light of the above, the OFTU (Organization for fair technology use) announced that it would completely replace several of its sub branches with sophisticated algorithms until 2025. This also includes the AIEB (artificial intelligence expert board), which was founded in 2014 to promote research cooperation and monitor fair and ethical use of machine learning between the members of the United Nations. Furthermore, this program ensured that monitoring standards of artificial intelligences are followed to address the widespread fear of algorithms taking over the world. 

Mrs Tarsicia Mayonga Almaraz, the current head of the OFTU, defends the decision of the organization among harsh criticism from different experts around the World. She argues that all of the current duties of the AIEB can be substantially be improved by using more state of the art digital tools, which are according to her, much better suited in systematically searching all the collected data for violations of the fair use and AI-monitoring standards of the agency than the current board of experts. Therefore, the provided service to the UN member states can be extended and improved in several strategic areas of the OFTU, while it is estimated to yield cost savings of several hundred thousand US Dollars per year, due to the abolition of the human workforce of the AIEB. “With this step the organization is ensuring its relevance and efficiency for the next decades”, mentioned Mrs. Almaraz to close the conversation.
